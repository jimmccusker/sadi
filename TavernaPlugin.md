# Installation instructions #

You can install the latest release of the SADI plugin from the **Advanced Â» Updates and plugins** menu in Taverna.

You can install the latest snapshot (between-release build: more up-to-date, but potentially less stable) of the SADI plugin by following the instructions at [HOWTO: SADI Taverna plugin snapshots](http://sadiframework.org/content/2010/09/02/howto-sadi-taverna-plugin-snapshots/).
